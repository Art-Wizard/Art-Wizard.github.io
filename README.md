# My Art Portfolio Website

This is my personal art portfolio website, where I showcase my artwork and provide information about my artistic practice. The website is built using HTML and CSS, and is hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Features

- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices
- Navigation bar that allows users to easily access different sections of the website
- Image gallery that displays my artwork in an organized manner
- Contact section that provides users with a way to get in touch with me

## Usage

To view my website, simply visit https://art-wizard.github.io/ in your web browser. From there, you can navigate the different sections of the website, view my artwork, and get in touch with me if you have any questions or comments.

## Contributing

This is a personal portfolio website, so I'm not currently accepting contributions from others. However, if you notice any bugs or issues with the website, feel free to open an issue on this repository and I'll do my best to address it.

## Todo
- Tool to add pictures easily to their corresponding categories.
- Interactive and lightweight way to view workflow of each picture from start to finish, if available.
- Interactive and lightweight way to view 3d models and workflow, if available.
